This code applies the AdaBoost algorithm to a movie dataset to predict whether a movie wins a "Start Tech Oscar" based on features like genre, marketing expense, and Twitter hashtags. It involves loading and exploring the data, handling missing values and outliers, normalizing skewed features, and encoding categorical variables. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and an AdaBoost classifier is trained with 5000 estimators. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics on the test data.
