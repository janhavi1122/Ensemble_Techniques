This code applies the AdaBoost algorithm for classification on a loan dataset. Initially, the dataset is loaded, and the features (X) and target variable (Y) are split. The data is then divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split. An AdaBoost classifier is created with 100 estimators and a learning rate of 1. The model is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set. The model's accuracy is evaluated using accuracy_score from the metrics module. Additionally, the code demonstrates how to use a logistic regression classifier as the base estimator in AdaBoost, creating a new model with 50 estimators and the same learning rate.
