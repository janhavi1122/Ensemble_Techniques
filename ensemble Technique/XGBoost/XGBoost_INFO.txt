This code demonstrates the use of XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, for classification using a movie dataset. The process includes data preprocessing (creating dummy variables for categorical columns), splitting the data into predictors and target, and training an XGBoost model. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix on the test set. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the optimal values for parameters like max_depth, gamma, subsample, and colsample_bytree, improving
