This code demonstrates the use of ensemble learning with a stacking classifier on the Iris dataset. It first imports necessary classifiers and libraries, then defines weak learners (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes). A meta-classifier (Logistic Regression) is used to combine the predictions of the weak learners. The StackingCVClassifier from the mlxtend library is employed to create the stacking model. The performance of each model (weak learners and the stacking classifier) is evaluated using 3-fold cross-validation, and the mean accuracy is printed for each model.
