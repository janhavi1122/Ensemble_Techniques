This code demonstrates the use of ensemble methods by evaluating three individual classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes) and two types of Voting Classifiers (Hard and Soft) on the Iris dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of each model is measured by their mean accuracy. The Voting Classifiers, which combine the predictions of individual models, outperform the individual classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 0.9467, demonstrating how ensemble methods can improve model performance.
