This code applies the AdaBoost classifier to a dataset for classification. It involves loading and exploring the data, handling missing values and outliers, checking feature skewness, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The data is split into training and testing sets, and an AdaBoost model is trained. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
